# Natural-Language-Processing-UMBC-
Natural Language Processing taught by Dr. Frank Ferraro is one of the toughest courses at UMBC. Every assignment in this course had 6 questions and each assignment was akin to a project in the intersection of Machine Learning/ Natural Language processing. In almost every question, we were handed over a data (training, developmental and test) which we were supposed to clean, analyze and then come up with techniques of our own to infer from the training data. I was one of the few people if not the only one in class to get a perfect score in almost every assignment and obtained perfect A grade. In this repository, I have uploaded every assignment and their corresponding solutions which should be educational for any new person coming into this field.
